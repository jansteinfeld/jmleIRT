## Overview

The `jmleIRT` package provides tools to estimate Rasch (1PL) model parameters using **Joint Maximum Likelihood Estimation (JMLE)** in R. The package supports bias correction and Warm's Weighted Likelihood Estimates suitable for psychometric research.

---

## Features

- Joint Maximum Likelihood Estimation of person abilities \(\theta_p\) and item difficulties \(\beta_i\).
- Bias correction to reduce estimation bias, including epsilon bias stabilization.
- Warm's Weighted Likelihood Estimates (WLE) for person abilities.
- Support for missing data (missing responses coded as `NA`).
- Verbose mode to trace iteration progress.
- Comprehensive unit tests for reliability.

---

## Installation

Install from CRAN:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("jmleIRT")
```

Or from GitHub development version:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jansteinfeld/jmleIRT")
```

---

## Usage Example
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(jmleIRT)

# Simulate response  40 persons (p) Ã— 5 items (i)
set.seed(123)
X <- matrix(rbinom(40 * 5, 1, 0.5), nrow = 40)

# Estimate Rasch model using JMLE with bias correction
fit <- jmle_estimation(X, max_iter = 200, conv = 1e-5,
                      center = "items", bias_correction = TRUE)

# Item difficulties (centered)
print(fit$beta)

# Compute Weighted Likelihood Estimates for persons
wle_res <- estimate_wle(X, fit$beta)

# Person ability estimates via WLE
print(wle_res$wle)
```

## Mathematical Model

## The Rasch Model

The Rasch model is a fundamental Item Response Theory (IRT) model used for dichotomous item data. The probability that person \( p \) with ability \(\theta_p\) answers item \( i \) with difficulty \(\beta_i\) correctly is modeled as:

\[
P(X_{pi} = 1 \mid \theta_p, \beta_i) = \frac{e^{\theta_p - \beta_i}}{1 + e^{\theta_p - \beta_i}}
\]

where \( X_{pi} \in \{0,1\} \) indicates the correctness of response.

## Joint Maximum Likelihood Estimation (JMLE)

JMLE simultaneously estimates person abilities \(\theta = (\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_P)\) and item difficulties \(\beta = (\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_I)\) by maximizing the joint likelihood of observed responses:

\[
L(\theta, \beta) = \prod_{p=1}^P \prod_{i=1}^I P(X_{pi} \mid \theta_p, \beta_i)
\]

This is typically solved via an iterative algorithm alternating updates for \(\theta_p\) and \(\beta_i\), until convergence criteria are met.

Although easy to implement and computationally efficient, JMLE estimates suffer from bias, especially in small samples or with extreme response patterns.

## Bias Correction Methods

To mitigate estimation bias, several techniques are implemented:

- **Epsilon bias correction:** Adding a small stabilization constant \(\varepsilon > 0\) to avoid infinite logits and stabilize extreme scores, promoting convergence and finite parameter estimates.
- **Analytical bias correction:** Based on theoretical adjustments to parameter estimates as described in recent psychometric literature [Bertoli et al., 2012; Lando & Bertoli-Barsotti, 2014].

These methods enhance the accuracy and robustness of the JMLE algorithm.
